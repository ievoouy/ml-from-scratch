# ML From Scratch 🧠

This repo documents my 2-month deep dive into Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI — starting from theory and math foundations to practical implementation.

## Structure
- **/notebooks/** – Hands-on Jupyter notebooks implementing algorithms from scratch  
- **/notes/** – Markdown summaries of theoretical concepts and math  
- **/projects/** – Mini-projects and experiments (ML, DL, LLMs)  

Stay tuned — I’ll keep updating this daily as I learn!
